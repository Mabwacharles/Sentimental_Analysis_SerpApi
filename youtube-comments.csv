Here are some problems that I encountered during setup and their solution:
In the SQL shell, you first need to change from JS to SQL, and connect to the root@localhost

>Mysql JS>  \sql
>Mysql SQL>  \connect root@localhost
>password

Then create the dataset:

> CREATE DATASET giraffe;

Then you need to go to popsql, and connect to this dataset, 
in the main window, on the top left corner, there is a blueish icon, click on it and click on manage connections
click on New Connection on the bottom left corner in the pop up window
select the type to be MySQL
enter the parameters like the instruction on the video and click connect",2021-09-28T13:45:51Z,3,0

CREATE TABLE student();
It shows "" Error Code: 1064. You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ')' at line 1 ""

Wonder what could it be ? Do i really need to use PopSQL since i already forgot the email i used for PopSQL and i dont want to connect any other email with it.

Also,when creating the Office Database with multiple tables,i noticed that when using emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY, it keeps on giving error but when i do it like this :-

INSERT INTO employee VALUES(101,'Jan','Levinson','1961-05-11','F',110000,100,1);

1. You need to create an account to get the download option for windows from the website so just create account using Windows
2.  After installation the Home screen of the application will look way different than that in this video, to get all the info in your POPsql home screen follow this steps
3. On the Top Mid of the screen you will see something called Popsql sample data, hover over it and click on manage connections when it pops out while hovering over it
4. In the Type section select MySql and enter all other details as shown in the video
5. Also make sure before doing all that your MySql should be up and running, do not close the Mysql application.

Francisco Chavez,"SSN don't uniquely identity people in the U.S. Not only is is possible for multiple people to have the same SSN, but it IS an actually thing that happens from time to time. Sometimes, it's more than two people that share an SSN. Systems that can't tell that more than one person can have the same SSN have created legal issues for people. On top of that, it is possible for a person to have their SSN legally changed. One of the common solutions to having too many people with your SSN, is to have your SSN legally changed. So, it is possible for people outside of Witness Protection to have more than one SSN throughout their lives. Getting your SSN changed creates all sorts of issues for the person that had it changed because it makes it nearly impossible to quickly and easily link them to their degrees, diplomas, and certifications when doing a background search. Not having a background can cause issues when you're trying to get something like a job or a loan. But, sharing a SSN with someone with a bad credit history or a wrap sheet can also cause those same issues.

Long story short, NEVER use SSN as a person's key-identifier in your database.",2021-05-19T22:39:22Z,0,0

1. The steps listed at 10:10:10 are no longer necessary, nor are they possible. 
2. The steps listed at 10:08:30 no longer work. At some point Apple stopped using Bash (Catalina supposedly), and use something called ""ZSH,"" which is ""different."" No one wants to explain how it's different, just that it is different. 
3. Step 2 no longer working means the command after 10:09 ~/.bash_profile doesn't work. Additionally, there is no folder called .bash_profile, nor can you create one, which means I'm out of ideas as to how to proceed.",2021-04-12T08:02:41Z,0,0

  I  am building a Business Website where in steps  ( 1 ) a Customer ( anyone this is not a Subscription nor membership site )  comes to my web site  Fills out a Form for DATA SUBMISSION into the Database.   ( 2 ) Once the DATA Form is filled out they press NEXT button ( 3 ) they are taken to a 3rd party PAYMENT page where they fill out a payment form and then press SUBMIT ( 4 ) once the SUBMIT button is pressed  payment is process ( 5 ) ONLY AFTER PAYMENT IS APPROVED   THEN I want the Data to be submitted into the data base.
QUESTION   Is  STEP # 5   completed with JS or some other language ?  *HOW do I complete the process where AFTER PAYMENT IS ACCEPTED from a 3rd party payment processor ( like STRIP or PAYPAL )    THEN the data from the Already filled out data form is submitted into the data base ??*   IS A WEBHOOK required to make this possible ?

Olaleye Blessing,"Thanks for this video Mike. I do have a question.
In the company database, you asked to -- Find all employees born between 1970 and 1975.

1.
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE birth_day >= '1970-01-01' AND birth_day <= '1975-01-01';

2.
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE birth_day BETWEEN '1970-01-01' AND '1975-01-01';

3.
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE birth_day >= 1970-01-01 AND birth_day <= 1975-01-01;

1 and 2 give the same result but 3 gives no result. 1 and 3 almost have the same syntax just that 3 doesn't have quotaion mark(1970-01-01 and 1975-01-01). What is the functon of the quotation mark in this instance?

assume we know the ID of Michael Scott.

Giles Kingsley,Joins-my nemesis.  What confuses me here is that you ask for employee Id and employee first name from the employee table but your select statement also selects branch Name from employee table.  How does that work when Branch Name isn‚Äôt in employee table? Should you not do two select statements for the 2 columns from employee table and the one from branch table and then join them?,2021-02-18T22:35:23Z,0,1
Hisham Somroz,this is in fact what a JOIN is. you can select a column from different table BUT you have to JOIN that table from which you're taking column from. what else do you think a JOIN is? it allows us to get record/records from different table based on a matching field or different case based on the scenario.,2021-02-27T10:43:58Z,0,

Your client has a table of transaction records and he is trying to aggregate it into positions:

SECURITY_ID	SIDE	QUANTITY	PRICE	LAST_TRADE_DATE
AAPL	BUY	1000	100.00	9/20/2014
GOOGL	BUY	2000	100.00	12/20/2014
AAPL	BUY	2000	110.00	10/20/2014
MSFT	BUY	1000	40.00	11/20/2014
MSFT	SELL	500	38.00	11/29/2014

Write SQL statements that will aggregate this into a table of positions.  Notice average cost and realized P&L should be computed, and the positions should be sorted by most recent trade date.  (10 points)

SECURITY_ID	QUANTITY	AVERAGE_COST	REALIZED_PL	LAST_TRADE_DATE
GOOGL	2000	100.00		12/20/2014

When I put SELECT student_name FROM student and then ORDER BY student_name; I get a syntax error. It says it wasn't expected at this position, expected EOF, ALTER, ANALYZE. etc. I am using MySQL Workbench 8.0 and even on the documentation I cannot find the error

Edit: Fixed my problem. For reference, try using 
TABLE table_name ORDER BY column_name; 
instead of doing it exactly as in the video if you get the same error I mentioned before.",2020-08-09T23:52:14Z,2,0

In the example that was used in the video, this will produce a full outer join in MySQL - incase anyone wants to see how it'll populate:

SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id
UNION
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name

Michael Thompson,"Just a comment on 'On Delete'. I never cascade delete, and almost never delete rows. It's far safer to have an attribute that is something like 'isCurrent' (caption Current?). When that binary is set to false, then you have a query that only pulls current = true, and that is what you normally access, not going to the table directly. That way you don't get in trouble with internal revenue when they're checking your books over, and you don't have any broken links, for example, branchId = 2 in another table when there is no branchId 2 in the branch table.
While deleting rows is a REALLY bad idea, archiving is sometimes a good idea. If your table gets 'too big', you can shift records off to an archived version of the table, and delete the rows from the original table. For example, you may want to do this for sales data that is, say, more than two years old. You still wouldn't delete the sales person, or the product name, etc., but you would archive this sales data, because a) you probably won't be wanting to access it any time soon and b) if you do want to access it you can always restore it to the main table (or merge a query on the archive table), but if you mess with the parent tables (sales person, products) by archiving rows your child table won't know where to go to get the names, and you've lost referential integrity.",2019-11-04T22:06:49Z,0,0

SauROnmiKE,"I just finished the course 10 minutes ago and it took about about 2 weeks to complete it all.

I have to say, I feel extremely grateful. The moment I left my pen finishing my notes as Mike closed the tutorial, felt amazing. I believe I built very strong foundation to take the next leap ahead. The course was great, it covered lots of details and if I still had a question, it was so small that a simple Google search or just experimenting was enough to solve it.

Now as Mike already said, it is a beginners course, which is fine. I feel more than ready to tackle more advanced stuff and I cannot wait to do so in the next few weeks. I feel ready to apply my new SQL knowledge in my favourite languages and take my game a step further.

I also saw that Mike has lots of other tutorials as well. Something tells me that I will learn more from him soon.
Thank you so much for creating this course for free and for actually investing your valuable time to teach us.",2019-10-14T11:28:02Z,0,0

systemctl start mysqld

First of all I would like to thank for Mike Dane for the tutorial it is really useful and understandable.

I noticed one not so important thing. In the video the name of the column of employee table referring to the date of birth is 'birth_date' but if you copy the database creation from his website it will be called 'birth_day'. Unfnortunately I could not figure out how to change the name of an existing coloumn in a table. Can anyone help me out with that?

Arpan Sood,@Harsh Abhiram Manik Yeah but if there is something on a computer which is available by default then it's perfect.

If you get a '1359 table already exists' error message after fixing a typo in the trigger when you re-input the information into the command line client, one should delete the trigger in popsql before trying to re input the information into the clc again. Also, if mysql disappears in the clc and you get this ->

 just type in \c, and this will erase what you wrote prior, and make mysql appear again. I'm a novice, so I would imagine that other novices may run into problems such as this as well and not know what's happening.",2019-07-16T20:46:29Z,0,0

thus by limiting the = to one output the = is not able to determine as there is also an AND statement b/w your code, to run the code with LIMIT try making the boundary as 2

For large projects it would be a really pain in the ass to write understandable and maintainable SQL code with a schema like this one.

Nephy Nomer,"Excellent class. Even though I started with ZERO SQL knowledge, I managed to create more complex query based on the lesson here. Thought I'd share the queries I've built.


The following query takes the data from the sample database, and extracts the Employee ID, Forename, Surname, Branch and Total sum of sales per staff member.


SELECT Employee.emp_id AS ID, Employee.first_name AS Forename, Employee.last_name AS Surname, Branch.branch_name AS Branch, SUM(Works_With.TOTAL_SALES) AS Sales
FROM Employee
LEFT JOIN Branch
on Employee.branch_id = branch.BRANCH_id
RIGHT JOIN Works_With
on Employee.emp_id = Works_With.emp_id
GROUP BY Employee.emp_id
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC;




This query changes the reported data to include the client ID and no longer groups the total sales figures by employee. Note that you can rename a column using the 'text' method to include spaces in the column title, such as 'Client Name' rather than Client_Name.
SELECT Employee.emp_id AS ID, Employee.first_name AS Forename, Employee.last_name AS Surname, Branch.branch_name AS Branch, Works_With.TOTAL_SALES AS Sales, Client.client_name AS 'Client Name'
FROM Employee
LEFT JOIN Branch
on Employee.branch_id = branch.BRANCH_id
RIGHT JOIN Works_With
on Employee.emp_id = Works_With.emp_id
LEFT JOIN Client
ON Works_With.CLIENT_id=Client.CLIENT_id
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC;

Joel McAllister,"Starts out great, I learned some great concepts for the first hour but after that his instructions can not followed. Apparently the errors Mike made were edited out of the video. As soon as you try to connect to the misspelled ""girafe"" vs ""giraffe"" database with Popsql the connection/s fails. Look closely at 1:01:17 time frame and you can see the error but next Mike shows himself connected the the data base. After spending a few hours trying figure out how to connect to the ""girraffe"" or the 2nd db I created ""giraffe"" I gave up. 

Sorry Mike, but editing out the errors without explanation discredits the great amount of work you must have put into creating the course.

So, the ""Hammer Mill"" value typically would be stored as ""hammermill"", or ""HAMMERMILL"". All is much easier if one agrees to not use mixed case, or whitespaces, in all primary key columns. Obviously, attribute columns - which is the data a database is about, have information in any desired case, and whitespaces as desired.",2019-01-10T10:31:56Z,0,0

We are fast losing trust in people. Don't rely too much on people. Rather be on the watch and don't be on the losing end. No one really deserves to be cheated upon. Be it spouses, partners, casual friends, co workers and even your sibling. You can catch your spouse\partner red-handed by spying and hacking into their phones/device. And Webghost the pro when it comes to this line of services ( skype : webghost33 ). They private investigative and break into all security system.

I had to figure out what went wrong and I followed along writing exactly what you wrote down.
Everyone, if you get the ""Unknown database"" error, check the spelling on the database you created a few minutes back.
It's irritating that someone would expect us to follow along, make a mistake, and just edit it out, not even telling their audience so they can be left to wonder why their stuff doesn't work but yours does.
Unless freecodecamp did the editing. They don't realize that the mistakes must be seen so that others don't stress over why their stuff doesn't work.",2018-10-16T00:11:43Z,16,2

If you want to emphasize a point, say it slowly and perhaps in two or three DIFFERENT ways.  But just repeating the same thing the same way two or three times doesn't help make your point--it just tends to be boring.  Be brief. Less is more. Remember...the viewer can always pause and back up the video if they miss something.

Having said that, your content and organization is great--as many of your viewers have already attested.  But, believe me, your courses will be much more effective and popular if you follow the simple style rules above.",2018-08-05T10:37:03Z,333,58

Teaching is an art, there is some science behind it and there is no one right way of doing it that works for every situation, and in tutorials it is even a bit more problematic, if I'm in a classroom I can keep an eye on my learners and look for cues on how to moderate the pace of the lesson and how much iteration and how far in depth we need to go.

Sauron Terrill,"Near the end of the Inner Joins section near 1:30:00 you state adding the alias in the SELECT clause doesn't really matter. I disagree. Not having the alias there only indicates the column name is unique somewhere in the query. In more complex queries involving several tables, this leads to confusion about where to look when troubleshooting. Even if your query isn't the problem, this creates a barrier to yourself or other developers when troubleshooting. Why make your future self or others go through that?",2021-08-12T12:06:38Z,0,0

Mr J,"Here's how you create a database from scrarch:
1. Think what tables you're gonna need
2. Plan what you're doing by drawing the tables on a piece of paper with a pencil
3. Go to a program on your computer like Toad Data Modeler for example and make the tables there
4. Once you're done there generate a ddl script. The ddl script you generate has sql queries for the tables you made in Toad Data Modeler
5. Choose a DBMS(Database Managment System) like PG Admin, Heroku, Elephant SQL,... to host your database there

Hope this helped a little",2021-08-09T08:25:34Z,0,

Unknown collation: 'utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci'	0.000 sec

Tried again to create that table by highlighting that line of code:  CREATE TABLE `payment_methods` (

In the second error, it is obvious that the app MariaDB is running.  But it isn't.  It's installed, and it uses Port 3306, but when setting up the MySQL as per this video, we chose to use Port 3307.  In checking the MySQL Administration panel/Server STatus, it shows that the Socket is MySql, but the Port is 3306; which is different from what we assigned during setup.

Michael Olanrewaju,"Hi Mosh! Thanks for this tutorial and the others, which you have made available on YouTube. Clean and clear videos.
A quick check at 1:09:40. WHERE first_name REGEXP 'elka|ambur' would fetch names that contain 'elka' or 'ambur'. For example, first names like Anelka, Tambura etc. would be part of the result if those names existed in the customers table.
I used one of the following:

WHERE first_name='elka' OR first_name='ambur'

WHERE first_name REGEXP '^elka$|^ambur$'

What are your thoughts?",2021-05-06T18:39:14Z,0,1

Andrei Tsurkan,"Hi Mosh! Thank you for your tutorial, I find it very useful.
I am just a beginner, but I've got a question, concerning one moment of your lesson, particularly 1:09:43. The task was to write a statement which would return the customers in the database whose names are Elka or Ambur . Your solution was with REGEXP, i.e. WHERE first_name REGEXP 'elka|ambur', - and it returned in fact the two customers from database, whose names were Elka and Ambur. But if there were customers in the database with first names, say, Telka or Bambur - we would get them as well, wouldn't we? So, in this way we get the customers, whose first names CONTAIN letter sequences ""elka"" and ""ambur"", rather than those whose names ARE  EXACTLY Elka and Ambur (as the original task was). Or have I got something wrong? Thank you very much",2021-04-21T10:49:51Z,0,0

Anthony Garza,"So, I tried to comment this earlier but for some reason it got instantly deleted so here I go again.  Hopefully this one doesn't get shuttled off to the dark recesses of the internet forever...

I'm sure a lot of you have noticed that the link to the ZIP files for the sample database doesn't work.  There are a few ways we can get around that.

1. According to a comment I read, you can apparently switch to a different browser that isn't Chrome, and the link should work just fine.  I haven't personally tested it, so if someone can let me know if it works so I can edit this comment, that would be great.

2. If 1 doesn't work, then use this link:  https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/i5NkVwu2R7IZisWYxVzE

3. If 2 doesnt work, then here is a link to the file on my google drive:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVSvqWRnzW_4twHB8v0A7N-AcpqEObTa/view?usp=sharing

Of course, you should be careful of clicking a link from a random stranger on the internet.  That's why I suggest instead of potentially sacrificing your computer, have your friend sacrifice theirs to be on the safe side.  However, I hope that I seem trustworthy enough :).  These links should work and get you the file, though if you obviously dont trust me then hopefully the first step worked.  

I don't think I'll get in trouble for posting those links, but if for whatever reason I broke a law in sharing the file myself... please have mercy on my poor soul :(",2021-04-07T16:32:07Z,5,2

FROM `order_items` 
WHERE `order_id` = 2

I really love it when you show the end result(i.e the first ORDER BY exercise).and say get this.  It took me 3 hours to get this.  Originally I said BETWEEN 6 AND 19.  I don't know if I'm dumb, or your teaching style is useless.  Probably not the latter, but I'd probably be spending days if this query didn't work out.  Just cause you said  the unit price * the quantity.  I just feel like if knew what type of information I was looking for in q query, like I need this, this, I need this.  I could possibly spend 3 hours and yet do it quicker(just in feeling), or I wouldn't feel as bad.  Don't know if that makes any sense.

If you're a windows user having issues with the create-database SQL file not loading any table data, do the following. I think it's a problem with the newer version of SQL. 

1. Open the file in a text editor
2. Find and replace the following text in the SQL file

Find: ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci;
Replace: ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_general_ci;

if you struggling to connect to your local server, go to your C drive (local diskdrive) - Program Files (x86) - MySQL - MySQL installer for windows - MySQL.Installer.Console and install it manually.
Also:
When reconfiguring if it says your port is already in use, you need to turn the MySQL off first. To do that: type ""services"" into windows search bar in the bottom left and click on services, window with a list opens, find MySQL, left click and select stop.

In some Google Chrome if not all, if you left click the link, it automatically opens a new tab but then suddenly close itself. and nothing downloaded. 

If you have similar experience, try the following (at least it works for me):
1. instead of left click-ing the link, try right click-ing it  -->then left click ""copy link address""
2. After that, manually open the ""new tab"" on your google chrome, then paste the link.

It will download the necessary files automatically. Hope it helps",2020-12-09T10:33:17Z,0,0

Didn't really get this one 100%. Cause you change the order of the tables in which you take FROM and which you JOIN.
But if I choose to change the order from right to left of the equal sign, I get the same results, so works both ways.

Poe Lemic,"Let me make a comment to everyone ... 12:10 ... Mine had a lot of things that failed.  But, they did not complete.  So, I think he made a mistake in saying which one to download.  If you have a problem and get a lot of FAILED (instead of COMPLETE).  Then, do this.  Go back to the site ( 10:39) and DO NOT SELECT THE FIRST ONE, select the second one (343.3Mb).  The second one is a FULL INSTALLER and the first one is a WEB INSTALLER.  So, you might have something setup where it can't get through your firewall or something, because you have Win10 and have Virus Protection turned on.  So, use the second one, and it seems to work better.  When you start the Installer the second time, tell it to DELETE EVERYTHING off, then start again.  Then, it should work this time.

I set up the databases both as a group and as individual databases using all your files and i have the same result. Can you help me please.- Thanks!",2020-07-20T00:02:06Z,0,0

after searching on web I just followed the following link

Elliot,"Hey, for the deleting rows code at 3:06:40 you will be given an Error Code: 1241. Operand should contain 1 column(s). This is because the subquery is returning multiple columns when it should only be returning the client id. To fix this issue all we have to do is change the * to client_id in the subquery. Your code will look like this: 

USE sql_invoicing;

DELETE FROM invoices
WHERE client_id = (
					SELECT client_id
					FROM clients
					WHERE name = ""Myworks""
)

This will fix your operand error, hope this helps :)",2020-07-14T03:42:39Z,6,1

Many of us got sucked into the MongoDB crap and slowly realizing it, but making the transition to SQL with JSON data is not as easy as there are alot of pitfalls.

I understand that you had already created sql databases and then gone from there. But how a person like me can learn properly or from scratch who does not have any idea and knowledge about on how to create database or databases, why need many databases, creating tables in sql or creating tables in different databases, functions, operators, creating relationships between tables and databases, what to call to different brackets and commands. Is there any other video of you here on youtube where I can learn all these things from scratch like from fresh start. Please do let me know. Thanks",2020-05-28T02:30:12Z,0,0

Robyn B.,"This would have been a fantastic refresher on things that I worked on 15-20 years ago(when I was a programmer). However, I had issues just trying to create the databases, before it really began?

NOTES: 

1.  (@~18:30) (minor) Upon creating the database  I received several instances of  

	warning: 1681. Integer display width is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. 



2.  (@ 18:48) The tables do not populate properly. 



What you show @18:48 is not what I see - I see schemas that show
V sql_invoicing
    Tables fetching...
    Views fetching...
    Stored Procedures fetching...
    Functions fetching...

(I would attach graphic, but this chat doesn't seem to support that.)


INTERESTINGLY - The sole exception was 'sql_hr' (which shows correctly) - I've examined the code between sql_hr and the other tables, but to my eyes they look virtually identical except for the data itself. 



I would also suggest the reason why some work and not others would be that MacOS and Linux are working, but Win10 is not. (Huge surprise, Microsloth strikes again.) 



Any help would be appreciated?",2020-04-25T03:42:25Z,0,1

Just for info: for those who had issues installing mysql on windows, I had to install first visual studio this was a manual installation required by the wizard.

In 2:57:33 Updating Multiple Rows explanations you wrote:


UPDATE invoices 
SET
      payment_total = invoice_total * 0.5,
      payment_date = due_date
WHERE client_id = 3 


With the comma after 0.5 (seel line three), but in exercise, for the same lesson (line three below) you don't use the comma (after number 50):


UPDATE customers
SET 
    points = points + 50

Dima Cedars,"Hi Mosh, 


in 2:57:33 Updating Multiple Rows you first create orders_archived table
CREATE table orders_archived AS
SELECT * FROM orders;


Then you delete everything from the invoices_archived table (use truncate function)
Then insert the information again

INSERT INTO orders_archives
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2019-01-01'


Why it doesn't work the same way in Exercises for this lesson? 


I create a new table
CREATE TABLE invoices_archived AS
SELECT * FROM invoices 


Then I delete everything using the truncate function, so the table is empty. Then I do this:


INSERT INTO invoices_archived
SELECT i.invoice_id, i.number, c.name AS client, i.invoice_total, i.payment_total, i.invoice_date, i.due_date, i.payment_date 
FROM invoices i
JOIN clients c
USING (client_id)
WHERE payment_date IS NOT NULL


But it gives me an error. 


The only way how I can do it if I do everything from scratch create a table instead of insert:


CREATE TABLE invoices_archived 
SELECT i.invoice_id, i.number, c.name AS client, i.invoice_total, i.payment_total, i.invoice_date, i.due_date, i.payment_date 
FROM invoices i
JOIN clients c
USING (client_id)
WHERE payment_date IS NOT NULL

Hasan Emin Balkaya,"On your first code, you order your output by 'total price' which is a string, this doesn't have any influence on sorting. You will get the same result if you remove that line. On the second code, total_price is the variable you define on your first line so it is taken into consideration. However, you should order your data on descending total price (Highest to lowest). Following is the solution:

SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS total_price
FROM order_items
WHERE order_id=2
ORDER BY total_price DESC",2019-09-04T16:46:51Z,0,

edureka!,"Yes, there is very little difference between Oracle Database and MySQL in terms of syntax other than row locking but besides that, Oracle database has a lot more features than MySQL and is very very secure. So if you are someone who works with security in mind, Oracle is the way to go but does cost money. MySQL, on the other hand, is for application-oriented places and is free for use.
